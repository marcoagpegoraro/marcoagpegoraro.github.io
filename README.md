# My personal Website, created with React
## You can access this website by typing in your address bar the following address: https://marcoagpegoraro.com.br or https://marcoagpegoraro.github.io

Fell free to clone this repository and see how i programmed the website.

This site was programmed using the most modern web development technologies, like [ReactJS](https://react.dev) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) together with recommended componentization practices, internationalization with the [i18n](https://www.i18next.com/) library, animations with CSS and [intersection observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API), in addition to the [Material UI](https://mui.com/) component library.

Made with ❤️ by myself, hosted on [GitHub Pages]([https://](https://pages.github.com/)) and domain registered at [registro.br](https://registro.br/) . 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You will need NPM to run this website in your local machine, clone this project, then run `npm install`, an then you can run one of the following commands:

## Available Scripts
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

### `npm run eject`
This command will remove the single build dependency from the project and then copy all the config files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into the project so you have full control over them.

##
### Deployment
To deploy in production, run the command `npm run deploy`, actualy, only i can use this command, this command will build React in production and automatically place the code in the master branch, which will be used by Github Pages.
